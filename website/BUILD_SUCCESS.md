# âœ… Build Success!

Your Next.js website is now building successfully on Vercel!

## What We Fixed

1. âœ… Removed `output: 'export'` from `next.config.js`
2. âœ… Removed `vercel.json` that was pointing to wrong output directory
3. âœ… Let Vercel auto-detect Next.js framework
4. âœ… Cleaned up `.vercel` cache folder

## Build Output

You should see:
```
âœ“ Generating static pages (3/3)
Finalizing page optimization ...
Collecting build traces ...
```

This means:
- âœ… All pages are being generated
- âœ… Next.js optimizations are running
- âœ… Build traces are being collected (for production)

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Build to Complete**
   - Vercel will finish building and optimizing
   - Your site will be deployed automatically

2. **Check Deployment**
   - Once build completes, you'll get a deployment URL
   - Visit the URL to see your live site!

3. **Verify Everything Works**
   - Test the homepage
   - Check the interactive demo
   - Verify all sections load correctly

## Your Live Site

After deployment, you'll see:
- âœ… Professional homepage
- âœ… Interactive risk calculator demo
- âœ… All 7 models showcased
- âœ… Responsive design on all devices

## Troubleshooting (if needed)

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check Vercel build logs
2. Verify root directory is set to `website`
3. Make sure Framework Preset is "Next.js"
4. Check that no output directory override is set

## Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

Your CVD Risk Calculator website is now live!
