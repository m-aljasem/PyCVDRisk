# Deployment Guide for Vercel

This guide will help you deploy the CVD Risk Calculator website to Vercel.

## âœ… Fixed Configuration

The website is now configured to work properly with Vercel's Next.js deployment.

## Quick Deploy

### Option 1: Via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to Vercel**
   - Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

2. **Import Your Project**
   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Select your GitHub repository
   - **IMPORTANT**: In project settings, set **Root Directory** to `website`
   
3. **Vercel Auto-Detection**
   - Vercel will automatically detect Next.js
   - Framework Preset: Next.js (auto-detected)
   - Build Command: `npm run build` (default)
   - Output Directory: `.next` (auto-detected)
   - Install Command: `npm install` (default)

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for the build to complete
   - Your site will be live! ðŸŽ‰

### Option 2: Via Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (globally)
npm i -g vercel

# Navigate to website directory
cd website

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy (for production)
vercel --prod

# Follow the prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? Yes
# - Which scope? (Choose your account)
# - Link to existing project? No
# - What's your project's name? cvd-risk-calculator
# - In which directory is your code located? ./
```

## Important Settings in Vercel Dashboard

When importing the project:

1. **Root Directory**: Set to `website`
   - This tells Vercel where your Next.js app is located

2. **Framework Preset**: Should auto-detect as "Next.js"
   - If not, manually select "Next.js"

3. **Build Settings**: Leave as default
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next` (auto-detected by Vercel)
   - Install Command: `npm install`

## Configuration Files

The project uses:
- **next.config.js** - Standard Next.js config (no static export)
- **vercel.json** - Minimal config (Vercel auto-detects most settings)
- **package.json** - Standard npm scripts

## Troubleshooting

### Error: routes-manifest.json not found

âœ… **FIXED**: This was caused by using `output: 'export'` in next.config.js. 
The config has been updated to work with Vercel's serverless functions.

### Build Fails

1. **Check Node Version**
   - Vercel uses Node 18.x by default
   - You can specify in `package.json`:
     ```json
     "engines": {
       "node": ">=18.0.0"
     }
     ```

2. **Check Build Logs**
   - View detailed logs in Vercel dashboard
   - Look for dependency or TypeScript errors

3. **Verify Dependencies**
   - Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
   - Run `npm install` locally to test

### Site Not Loading

1. **Check Root Directory**
   - Must be set to `website` in Vercel project settings

2. **Check Framework Detection**
   - Should show "Next.js" as framework

3. **Redeploy**
   - Sometimes a fresh deploy fixes issues

## Environment Variables

Currently, no environment variables are needed. If you add API keys or secrets later:

1. Go to Project Settings > Environment Variables
2. Add your variables
3. Redeploy

## Custom Domain

1. Go to your project in Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings > Domains**
3. Add your custom domain
4. Follow DNS configuration instructions

## Performance

The site is optimized with:
- Next.js automatic optimizations
- Image optimization
- Automatic code splitting
- Server-side rendering where beneficial

## Continuous Deployment

By default, Vercel will:
- âœ… Deploy on every push to `main` branch
- âœ… Create preview deployments for pull requests
- âœ… Show build status in GitHub

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. âœ… Update GitHub links in the website code
2. âœ… Add real favicon
3. âœ… Configure custom domain (optional)
4. âœ… Add analytics (optional)
5. âœ… Test all links and functionality
